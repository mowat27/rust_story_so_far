# Rust: My Story So Far

Examples from my talk at [CodeCraft](https://www.codecraftuk.org/events/2020/10/rust) on 15 Oct 2020.

In this months codecraft, we are trying another interactive talk. Adrian Mowat will be presenting his talk “Rust: my story so far”.

Rust has been Stack Overflow’s most loved language for four years in a row, indicating that many of those who have had the opportunity to use Rust have fallen in love with it. However, the roughly 97% of survey respondents who haven’t used Rust may wonder, “What’s the deal with Rust?”

Adrian says: “I had a lot of time on my hands during lockdown and I decided to learn Rust. In this talk I will show you what I’ve learned and try to answer the big question: is Rust the next big thing or is it a solution looking for a problem?”.

This is a talk given by David Beazley where he live codes a stack machine in Python and uses it to run a game written in Rust and compiled to Web Assembly.

This game is written in Rust and runs in the browser using WebAssembly.  :warning:  It uses an older version of the rust WebAssembly toolchain so it may be tricky to run the code yourself.
